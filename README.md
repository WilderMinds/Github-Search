# Github-Search

This is a simple app that uses the github API to search github repositories, view repository details, and view information about the author and contributors.

The purpose of this project is to explore building with Clean architecture.

In the **master branch*, the app is built with the regular MVVM architecture.

In the **clean-architecture* branch, the app takes the regular MVVM architecture further by applying Clean Architecture principles.
